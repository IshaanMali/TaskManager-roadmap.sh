How to use this project:
Each task has 4 attributes - their unique id, the task description, the status of the task (which can be todo, in_progress or done) and the time the task was created at. If the task gets updated, the time the task was updated at is also added as an attribute.
To add a task - type "add", followed by a task name in quotations to add a task, for example - add "Buy groceries". You will get a task id in return from this, which will be useful for the following functions.
